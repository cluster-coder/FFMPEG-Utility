A really simple python script to convert all the videos inside a folder to audio.  
(Originally from the repository [Utilities-and-Mockups](https://github.com/cluster-coder/Utilities-and-Mockups/tree/main/FFMPEG%20Utility)) 

Just execute the script and paste the folder's path.

IMPORTANT:
Needs FFMPEG installed in your system!
You can install it going to their official website.
